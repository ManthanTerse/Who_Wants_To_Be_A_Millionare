💰 Project: “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” – Quiz Game 🐍 

This is one of the projects from my 30 Days Python 🐍 Challenge, where I’m building 10 projects in 30 days (1 project every 3 days).Inspired by India’s top quiz show Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) 🎧💼, this Python-based terminal game recreates the excitement of winning increasing prize money with each correct answer!
